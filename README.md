# Card Pokémon API

This is an additional implementation to the profile card component challenge on Frontend Mentor. Using the [Initial Project](https://github.com/Leandro-Lr-Ln/Profile-card) as a base, I have done a simple practice consuming the Pokemon public API.

## Overview

### The challenge

The user should be able to see the basic characteristics of a **random pokémon**:

- Name
- Exp
- Hp
- Photo
- Attack
- Special
- Defense 

### Built with

- HTML 5
- SASS
- JS
- API
